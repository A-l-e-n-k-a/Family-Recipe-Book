    <div class="intro">
        <p> <em> We started making these tasty waffles after our good family friends relocated back to Australia. While
                they were packing their English home they gave us many of their gadgets, including their waffle maker.
                <br />I then searched the Internet for the perfect yeast-based waffle recipe which I later addapted to
                make it even better. They need prepping the night before but then it's super easy to make them the
                following morning for delicious breakfast. <br />
                Thank you Kim and Ryan for introducing us to waffles.</em></p>

            <h3> Ingredients </h3>
            <ul>
                <li> 340ml milk, lukewarm </li>
                <li> 85b butter, melted </li>
                <li> 2-3 tbs maple syrup, optional </li>
                <li> 3/4 tsp salt </li>
                <li> 1tsp vanilla extract </li>
                <li> 2 large eggs </li>
                <li> 240g plain flour </li>
                <li> 1 1/2 tsp instant yeast </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="method">
            <ol>
                <li> Combine all of the ingredients in a large bowl, leaving room for expansion; the mixture will bubble and
                grow.</li>

                <li>Stir to combine; it's OK if the mixture isn't perfectly smooth.</li>

                <li> Cover with plastic wrap, and let rest at room temperature for 1 hour; the mixture will begin to bubble.
                You can cook the waffles at this point, or refrigerate the batter overnight to cook waffles the next
                day.</li>

                <li> Preheat your waffle iron. Spray with non-stick vegetable oil spray, and pour 2/3 to 3/4 cup batter (or
                the amount recommended by the manufacturer) onto the center of the iron. Close the lid and bake for the
                recommended amount of time, until the waffle is golden brown. It takes us 10 minutes to make ours using adeep-pocket waffle iron.</li>
